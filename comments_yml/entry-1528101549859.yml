message: "Thanks Matthew and Grant for the comments! \r\n\r\nMatthew, I have checked your blog, you have nice examples on different topics! I haven't really tested zmq for communicating between threads, but it seems to be a popular approach. I've checked in one of your examples that you use zmq in combination with Qt. I wonder why you took this approach instead of using signals and slots. \r\n\r\nGrant, thanks for the links. In the application I had in mind (streaming from a camera), caching to disk is not a good option, because the data generation rate is higher than write-to-disk speed. However, this approach can extend the time during which you can acquire from a camera (or any other high-speed acquisition device). That is why knowing how big your buffer could be is of tremendous help, in order to stop the acquisition before an out-of-memory exception. In any case, I will take a better look at your project, since it seems something I could use at some point."
