message: "Thanks a lot for this awesome article, it's well written and very helpful. \r\n\r\n`python -m doctest -v factorial.py`\r\n\r\nMy question is what does the `-m` do when used with the python command, i see it a lot and tried searching for it, but to no avail. I'd also appreciate if you can also maybe point me to a link where all the possible arguments are shown. \r\n\r\nThanks. :-)"
