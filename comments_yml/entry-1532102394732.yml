message: "Night family devotions had been one of the most essential elements of Lee and Larry?s day.\r\n\r\nDaddy read part of the story of Jesus coming at Christmas which is the place he learn yearly throughout December so theyd know the \r\ntrue cause for Christmas, to rejoice the birth of Jesus.\r\n\r\nOn the end of it, Lee asked, ?Daddy, did Jesus get a birthday party every year with \r\npresents and a clown too?"
