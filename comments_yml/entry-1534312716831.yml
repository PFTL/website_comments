  These are good learning exercises, but im afraid that people will take it as
  advice! I would never recommend that someone write their own CSV writer/parser
  as you've described. There's just too many hidden edge cases (quote escaping
  being just the tip of the iceberg) and too many great existing tools that do a
  great job. You should at least mention these - CSV.DictReader,
  pandas.DataFrame.read_csv() and petl.fromcsv() are a few options that are easy
  to use,  quite powerful, and will save a ton of headaches.
