  The idea is that if you would like to expand a tuple, you would need to create
  a new one with extra values, while a list can be expanded without duplicating
  the initial object. This makes lists faster in both ways if you want to append
  new objects: memory and running. However, if you access the elements often,
  tuples are more efficient. The balance between one or the other depends on the
  application.
