message: "It was August. We spent the morning packing the car. Our son, Mike was leaving for college. It was morning but already \r\nit was 90 degrees outside. Mike and husband, and I were getting pretty sweaty loading <a href=http://www.online.uillinois.edu/catalog/clicks.asp?URL=http://www.Pornoglobal.me>СЃРјРѕС‚СЂРµС‚СЊ РїРѕСЂРЅРѕ</a>\r\n<a href=http://www.rensselaerny.gov/events/eventsdetails/14-06-10/science_fair_at_library.aspx?returnurl=http://www.Opinails.de/>СЃРјРѕС‚СЂРµС‚СЊ РїРѕСЂРЅРѕ</a>\r\n  up the car. The trunk was already full and the back seat wouldn't fit much more. Mike went back in the house to get the last of his things. \r\nI heard him come out of the house. I turned around and saw him carrying his 42 inch flat screen TV. \r\n\"Where are you going to put the TV?\" I heard his father ask. \r\n\"I don't know, but I don't want to leave it. Maybe we can move some stuff around in the back seat.\" \r\nI looked in the back seat. \"I don't think so, son.\" Mike looked in the car. \"We can put it in the middle of the front seat.\" \r\n\"Ok, college man,\" I said. \"Then where is your mom going to sit?\" \r\nI could see on his face he was trying to come up with a <a href=http://tede.est.edu.br/?a<>СЃРјРѕС‚СЂРµС‚СЊ РїРѕСЂРЅРѕ</a>\r\n<a href=http://www.crh.noaa.gov/nwsexit.php?url=http://www.Opinails.de>СЃРјРѕС‚СЂРµС‚СЊ РїРѕСЂРЅРѕ</a>\r\n  solution. \"I got an idea,\" he said. He opened the passenger side door. He put the TV in the middle. He then got in and sat down. \"See plenty of room. Here mom sit next to me.\" I tried to sit next to my son. I could sit in the seat, but the door wouldn't close. \r\nNow, I am not a big woman. I stand about five feet tall and I only weight hundred pounds. It was my son \r\ntaking up all the room. He was already over six feet tall and weighed around two hundred pounds. \"It's not me that's \r\ntaking up all of the room, it's you. This isn't going to work. Tell you what, leave the TV and when we come to visit you we'll bring it with us.\""
